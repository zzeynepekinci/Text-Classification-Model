# Text-Classification-Model

I developed a logistic regression model to classify sports and astrology texts. The model:

Converted texts into numerical form using 1-hot encoding.
Utilized the tanh activation function and Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms for learning.
Implemented weight updates from scratch in C language and analyzed accuracy using test data.
Through this project, I gained experience in optimizing machine learning algorithms, text processing techniques, and working with data structures.
